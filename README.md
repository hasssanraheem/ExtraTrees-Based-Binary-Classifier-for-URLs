# ExtraTrees-Based-Binary-Classifier-for-URLs
This project implements a binary classification model for URLs using the ExtraTrees Classifier. It analyzes extracted URL features to predict whether a URL belongs to one of two categories (e.g., safe or malicious). The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
